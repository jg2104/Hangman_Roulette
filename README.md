Hangman Roulette is a fun little twist on our classic game of Hangman. Instead of just guessing letters until you win or lose, this version adds a roulette wheel that spins every time you guess a letter correctly. The roulette can either help you or mess things up. You can gain a life, lose a life, reveal a random letter etc. That randomness makes every round feel different and adds suspense.
